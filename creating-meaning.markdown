[![Meaningful Work][1]][2]

Value grows from doing things that matter.

The human soul is driven largely by its quest for meaning; it’s a big part 
of what makes us tick. When we “throw our heart and soul” into the work of 
an organization, we do so for reasons that go well beyond simple financial 
considerations. The organizations that understand how to engage us at that 
level are able to move mountains.

This kind of soulful connection to our work generates a deep sense of ownership 
and accountability for what we do. _Soulful companies_ purposefully extend 
this meaning and accountability to employees, customers, partners, investors 
and other important stakeholders. In so doing, they create a community of shared 
meaning; one that builds tremendous economic _and_ social value.

### [The Divine Right of Capital][4]

The Divine Right of Capital, by Marjorie Kelly is one of those mind-opening 
books that deserves to be read by a large audience. It represents a dramatic 
rethink of the corporation and asks some very hard questions about the nature 
of capitalism as we practice today. In this post, I summarize each chapter 
with the permission of the author, in the hope you’ll go out an read this important 
book.

It is time to find a richer understanding of fairness; one that incorporates 
both its libertarian and egalitarian sensibilities. The dynamics of libertarian 
and egalitarian fairness are what built this country. It is what made us great 
– and it is one of the keys to returning us to that greatness.

### [“Thick Value” Looks Like a Carpet to Me][8]

When companies deliver goods and services that truly leave the world better 
off, that’s “thick value.” That means creating real economic value; not simply 
capturing it from customers or suppliers, but genuinely making everyone better 
off.

[Netflix Explodes Its Customer Goodwill][12] Netflix is slowly exploding all its goodwill with customers, through a series of decisions on pricing and reshaping its service offerings. It's been a bad six months for the company, and I don't see things turning around for them again for a while ... if ever. It's too bad. It's a good company that just made some bad decisions.

[Software Will Replace You][13] Software-based businesses like Amazon and Netflix are rapidly displacing traditional businesses, but it goes much deeper than that. Software will soon replace much of what you do at work - and at lower cost and with better service. The question is - how far will we take this? Will software someday run our companies?

[Social Enterprise and the Renaissance of Local News][14] The old business model for local news is deep in debt and essentially running on fumes. The notion of a truly mission-driven news entity is quite compelling. We see examples of it running quite effectively in the nonprofit world in entities such as YES! Magazine, Grist, and High Country News. While these organizations have editorial voices and geographic territories that make them operationally quite different from a local newspaper, they do paint a picture of what could be possible on a municipal level.

[The Great Unbundling and Collapse of Local Newspapers][15] The web's unbundling of the local newspaper business model didn't occur all at once, but as a one-two punch of vertical marketplaces for easily aggregated data like car buying, and crowd-sourcing platforms to get at the fragmented, more difficult to aggregate information in local markets. In essence, what the Internet did was enable web-based businesses to cherry-pick the profitable pieces out of the local newspaper's business model. When that happened, the flow of money for reporter salaries came under increased pressure and newsrooms across the US were slowly eviscerated.

Did you write “Creating Value, Meaning, and Accountability” just for me? I 
suppose not…but it’s a great summation of how I used to feel about my work, 
what changed, and why I’m leaving…  Can’t wait to read more. Thanks!
