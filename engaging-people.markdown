#  Engaging People in the Work 

[![I'm engaged!][1]][2]

Engagement is building relationships and putting those relationships to work 
to accomplish shared goals.

Engagement isn’t just about clicking links or _liking_ something on Facebook. 
It’s a deepening of relationships that builds partnerships and collaboration 
as a means of creating economic and societal value.

Companies that know how to deeply engage employees, partners, customers and 
other key stakeholders in their work have an insurmountable advantage over 
other firms.

These companies are powered by the greatest force on the planet: _the human 
soul_.

You can think of connections as analogous to the packaging that wraps a product 
you buy at the store. The underlying “product” is the activity, or work, you 
want to coordinate with someone; the packaging is the connection between you.

I love it when a scientist comes along and proves something that, on an intuitive 
level, I just knew had to be true. That’s what just happened for me while watching 
Martin Nowark talk about his work on cooperation…. Just as I suspected: cooperation 
isn’t all fluffy white bunnies.
