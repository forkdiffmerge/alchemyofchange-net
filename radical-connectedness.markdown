#  Radical Connectedness and the Evolution of Business 

Categories: 

[Permeability & Networks][26]

November 16, 2011

 by [Gideon Rosenblatt][19]	

[![][27]][27]This summer, my wife and I took our two boys to visit the famous 
[Ford Rouge Complex][28] in Dearborn, Michigan. This Ford Motor Company factory 
was once the wonder of the industrial world, where Henry Ford pioneered America’s 
leadership in last-century manufacturing.

## Hub Controls the Spokes

The Rouge Plant was the first large-scale example of “**_[vertical integration][29]_**” 
– where companies _control_ all the inputs needed for their manufacturing processes. 

[![][30]][31]Ford built the Rouge plant to run like a giant machine, sucking 
in iron ore and timber on one side and spitting out automobiles and automobile 
parts on the other. You can think of the Rouge plant’s vertical integration 
as a giant hub, with all the spokes of inputs and outputs running into and 
out of an all powerful center. Ford used the humming, machine-like efficiency 
of this **hub and spokes model** to minimize the threat of interruption to 
his manufacturing processes and turn this self reliance into the pinnacle of 
operating efficiency for its time.

## Steps to Radical Connectedness

The day after our visit to Dearborn, we drove through Detroit – headquarters 
to General Motors, the automotive giant that later took vertical integration 
to gargantuan proportions. I won’t dwell on the impact of GM’s fall, or what 
it’s done to that community, but it’s clear that vertical integration is no 
longer the key to manufacturing growth. In fact, you could say it’s the exact 
_opposite_ of where modern organizational design is now moving: **from self-reliance 
to a _radical connectedness_**_._

Our first, awkward, blocky steps in this direction were **o_utsourcing_**, 
where companies hand off pieces of what they don’t do well to other organizations 
that can do it better. I say “blocky” because, in our first steps in this direction 
in the 1990′s, most of what got outsourced were _big blocks_ of a company’s 
activities. For example, firms might outsource all of their customer support 
to call center specialists that were better at that kind of work. Back then, 
we relied on legal contracts to ensure each party upheld its responsibilities 
in a collaborative value creation process because we lacked the tools to coordinate 
lots of _small, loosely joined_ pieces of work (or “business processes”) between 
firms.

[![][32]][33]

The Internet changed all that. Today’s radical connectedness is largely fueled 
by “**_connection technologies_**” like websites, email, SMS, databases that 
take for granted the “always-on” reliability of our new communications networks. 
These new technologies are essential to an organization’s ability to coordinate 
work with people outside its org charts.

Essential, but not sufficient.

You can think of these tools are “enabling technologies” in the sense that 
they _enable_ a new generation of organizational strategies and processes. 
And of these, one of the most important, if still under-appreciated is the 
“**modularization of business processes**.”

> 
> [Modular][34]: composed of standardized units or sections for easy construction or flexible arrangement. 
> 

Without getting too geeky, let’s just say that when we make it easy to connect 
small pieces together, we make it easy to connect things in unexpected ways. 
Think Legos, but with the various tasks and jobs companies do in order to create 
value. **_Modularizing_ business processes, gives us greater flexibility in 
_who does what, which enables us to specialize and more effectively collaborate 
with others_.** And that is the key to radical connectedness.

The radical connectedness that connection technologies and business process 
modularity bring transforms the old hub and spoke model into a new model: **the 
network model**.

## The Original Cellular Network

[![][35]][36]

Networks are everywhere you look in nature, and of these, the most amazing 
are the ones that connect cells: the cellular networks that make life on this 
planet even possible.

There came a point in the evolution of the cell when physics prevented it from 
getting any bigger, and life’s innate drive for intelligence nudged it to a 
different strategy: **modularity**.

Think Legos, but with biology.

The **cellular membrane** is the ‘_connection technology_‘ that enables cells 
to connect with each other in cellular networks. This protective structure 
doesn’t just surround the cell and separate it from its environment like some 
simple barrier or wall. It’s a _permeable_ boundary embedded with connections 
that enable the cell to exchange physical resources as well as information 
with its environment. These connections, which include both _receptors_ and 
_ion channels_, are what give the cell its intelligence of, and ability to 
coordinate with, other cells.

Over time, evolutionary forces helped some cells specialize in certain functions 
and others in others. Their membranes gave them the standardization they needed 
**modularize for “easy construction and flexible arrangement” across their 
networks**. Through this radical connectedness, cells became amazing collaborators, 
coordinating and combining themselves into the remarkable array of biological 
forms we see all around us – our eyes and hands, tigers and armadillos, bamboo 
and mosquitos — everything we think of as alive.

## Why Vertically Integrate, When You Can Network?

Like the cell, companies eventually hit a roadblock when they use size to compete 
and create value. Bureaucracy, sluggishness, rigidity, risk aversion, and a 
preoccupation with internal affairs are just some of the problems associated 
with this strategy, and they point to a new direction – the direction of radical 
connectedness.

For today’s startups, the richness of connection technologies, and the easy-to-connect 
with partnerships they enable, mean that there’s all kinds of work they just 
don’t have to do. Why worry about doing it all, when partners can pick up pieces 
of the value chain that aren’t really your thing? **Why vertically integrate, 
when you can network?**

As I’ve noted [before][37], today’s value-creation networks aren’t limited 
to traditional outsourcing partnerships. They also include value creation with 
customers. Think about companies like Twitter and Facebook and [their amazing 
collaborations with customers][38]. Without these users interacting with these 
services, there would be no Twitter or Facebook.

The radical connectedness of modularity and connection technology extends to 
_all_ points of contact with the firm. The companies that really get that are 
the leaders of tomorrow.

## The _Nature_ of the Firm

We’ve come a long way since the days when the Ford Rouge Complex was the cutting 
edge of organizational design. But in some ways, we’re still stuck in the old 
model. Though we might not _say_ it explicitly, we still tend to _think_ of 
the corporation as a kind of machine; a mechanical, deterministic thing that 
we wind up and point in the direction of making money.

That is the old model, where connections are deliberate, planned and controlled, 
and it is not the true nature of the firm. The true nature of the firm _is_ 
nature, and it is now time to look to biology for guidance on how it creates 
value in the new, networked era — the era of radical connectedness.

This is terrific description of the move to networks. We still, I believe, 
have to more thinking about the infrastructures — not just technological but 
institutional as well — that all these small pieces loosely joined to thrive 
and not be just as subject to the fall of a single industry or business.

Thanks Marnie. That’s a good point that I didn’t even go into in this piece, 
which is the benefits of redundancy that radical connectedness brings. In the 
old days of Ford, risk reduction came through controlling all the resources 
via vertical integration. Today, that risk reduction comes through interoperability, 
standardization, API’s and other mechanisms for openness and connection.

Gideon, this post has made me take the cob webs off a partially-written piece 
about Complex Adaptive Systems and their relationship between the economy and 
the ecosphere. I will see what I can do to finish writing down my ideas and 
publish a post on that topic in a few days.

The thought that comes to mind after reading your piece is that, unlike evolved 
biological systems, human constructs like businesses and cooperative structures 
are veritable neophytes on the evolutionary scale. It took single-celled creatures 
many millions of years of evolution before the benefits of multicellular cooperation 
were discovered. Whereas humankind can act in a faster timeframe due to the 
nature of our multicellular-powered systems, we are still very young in our 
quest to perfecting cooperative and collaborative interactions between other 
humans.

I’m really glad to hear that, Jeff. Let me know when you publish it. I’ll look 
forward to reading it. 

And yes, that’s a great perspective to throw into the mix. We’re still not 
even newborns, when it comes to comparing our organizational networks with 
the rigorous environmental/evolutionary testing that the cellular networks 
have been exposed to. We can iterate faster, for sure, but that’s a lot of 
catching up to do!

Gideon, I enjoyed your post and views.

But how do we quickly see the connections, inside an organization and/or outside? 
How do we make sense of the whole of the company or situation?I think you will 
enjoy this 118 second company knowledge blast video showing the whole by connections.

This is actually what the “cloud” is all about but unfortunately it’s been 
denigrated into IT infrastructure outsourcing by the brands and geeks. Your 
message is why I hate people saying “cloud is nothing new” – the typical salesperson’s 
scam to keep the client at ease, or that we’ve had cloud in the guise of Hotmail 
or Google mail and they are good examples – in that case just a case of pure 
ignorance.

Cloud is transformational because it enables what you describe in business 
terms.

Gideon  
 Self organising business proces networks that are assembled & selectively applied by business users on the fly; without having to write code, will make their debut in 2012.  
 It’s going to be a great year for business innovation & job creation.

Interesting. Would love to know more about what you’re talking about here. 
Do you have a link to more info?
