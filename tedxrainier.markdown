#  My TEDxRainier Talk on The Soulful Company 

Categories: 

[Humanity & Soulfulness][4], [Popular][5]

 by [Gideon Rosenblatt][6]	

I’m excited to share with you, for the first time, my TEDxRainier talk from 
last November, here in Seattle.

It’s on **The _Soulful_ Company**.

I’m using this talk as a catalyst to shift my focus here at _Alchemy of Change_ into 
a place for exploring some of the questions I hope to pique with this talk. 
A good place to start is on the [Soulful Company][7] page here on the site.

I loved the talk, Gideon. I’ve felt this way about companies for quite some 
time, but couldn’t find the right word to put to it. Whenever I come across 
a business that is composed of people who are absolutely in love with what 
they do, I am more than happy to support them and tell my friends about their 
work. 

Keep up the good work,

Dpalmer

Thanks so much for your comment. I know exactly what you mean. It just makes 
you want to work with that company, huh?

Gideon:  I really enjoyed your TEDx talk.  Well done and it really hit the spot.  Really liked the distinction you drew between merely tapping the soul and feeding it.  So important.  And a sense of meaning can come from any number of sources…not just service to society, but to one’s family, one’s co-workers and employees, one’s vendors, etc.  I could go on and on.  You have hit upon the major issue of my working life since 1990; back then, I vowed I would not leave my heart at home when I go to work in the morning.  
 Well done Gideon.

Thanks so much for your comment, Bobby. It really is the heart of what makes 
you want to head into work each day when you work in an environment like that. 
Hope you’re doing well.

Very convincing, Gideon. I mean it.

Is ‘Alchemy of Change’ hiring?

Thanks Darren. I’m just a one-man shop though…
