##  What is the Focus of Alchemy of Change?

There are two great levers we humans use to shape our modern world: organization 
and technology.

[![][2]][2]Come help me explore the impact these two forces have on the micro 
and the macro; on each of us as individual human beings and on society and 
the planet on which is relies.

**Organization** is the way we humans come together to coordinate work. We’ve 
been doing it since before we were even human. The _way_ we organize ourselves 
is changing, thanks in large part to new technologies of connection. Top-down 
hierarchies aren’t going away, but they are making room for networks and forms 
of less formal types of collaboration. These changes in the _way_ we organize 
ourselves affect us on a deeply personal level; some might even call it the 
level of the soul. At the same time, our organizations also deeply impact society 
and the other living systems on which it relies.

**Technology** accelerates change like no other force on the planet. On a individual 
level, it shapes the way we think, the way we live, what we eat, and eventually 
it will reconstruct us. Technology also shapes our organizations, and through 
them, it shapes the way we structure our society. Technology is now even competing 
with the most basic forces of nature to reshape the planet in fundamental ways. 
In the end, technology may well transcend organization. In that process, what 
will it do to society and to the soul?

## What’s the Perspective Here?

Every writer has a bias. As powerful as technology and organization are, they 
are both neutral forces. Each can be used to create health and happiness or 
pain and suffering.

I’m a huge technology enthusiast – a geek, through and through – and I like 
thinking about networks and new organizational structures. But I believe we 
are using technology and organization in ways that are causing us to lose our 
way as a species – and that it is time to stop doing that.

[![][3]][3]I think of technology and organization as today’s alchemy. They 
are our two most powerful tools for change.

Alchemists of old were purported to be able to transform lead into gold: a 
metaphor for fully tapping that greater something that resides deep inside 
each and every one of us – whatever we may choose to call it. Joseph Campbell 
used to call it the hero within each and every one of us. I like that. To me, 
it represents the best of our shared _humanity_. And if you look closely, you 
will find that hope embedded in all that you read here.

Thank’s for coming. I’m hoping to create some conversation here through your 
comments on individual posts here and on [Google+][4].

Gideon, great point of view. There are some companies which have been doing 
this for some time. The John Lewis Partnership in the UK, over the last 150 
years, and Gore Tex Associates in the US, and I am sure there others. They 
are successful, fulfilling to work for and social responsibility aware, so 
why aren’t they emulated? Maybe because they are private as opposed to public 
companies, which might suggest that the issue lies with the processes we use 
to define what public companies do, how we hold them accountable and the way 
they are perceived. (?)

Thanks for the thoughts, David, and I think you are right on here. The more 
I dig into this whole thing, the more and more that ownership structure comes 
back time and again as one of the key sources of dysfunction. It’s one of the 
reasons that I’m such a fan of Marjorie Kelly and her book “The Divine Right 
of Capital.”

Thank you for this work Gideon. It takes a lot of courage to take this to the 
level you are pushing it. I wish you the best.
