[![][1]][1]

What would it take to make our companies and the other institutions in our 
lives more _soulful_ places? I ask this question, not from the perspective 
of somebody trying to inject religion, or even necessarily spirituality into 
our places of work. Instead, I ask it from the perspective our shared humanity, 
that part deep within each of us that is greater than what we are on the surface. 

The soulful company is the organization that knows how to not just _tap_ that 
part of us, but _feed_ it as well.

This website is where I ask you to join me in exploring the notion of the soulful 
company, which I first asked publicly in a big way at my [TEDxRainier talk 
in 2011][2].

When I speak of the soulful company, it is not in reference to some idealized, 
old-fashioned company of yesteryear. I speak of it in _future tense_, as something 
we haven’t yet quite attained, even though there are signs of it now slowly 
emerging in a variety of organizations.

The soulful company that I envision is deeply intertwined with technological 
innovation, which is the other thrust of my writing. It harnesses the power 
of innovation and technological change, not just as a way to make profits, 
but also as a way to engage humanity more fully in the intrinsic meaning and 
dignity of work. In this sense, the soulful company is a catalyst for a “**bright 
blue**” revolution in the way companies connect with people, and like [bright 
green environmentalism][3], it aims to provide a deeper sense of prosperity 
through the use of new technologies and improved design.

The  categories below represent some of my latest explorations on the edges 
of this notion of the soulful company. They will no doubt grow and change in 
the years ahead. For now, I encourage you to dive in, explore, and feel free 
to engage me in getting to know this coming shift in the way we organize our 
work.

[![][4]][2][TEDx Talk on The Soulful Company][2]

This is my November 2011 TEDxRainier talk on “The Soulful Company.” It’s designed 
to get us to start bringing together these two very different concepts: the 
company and the soul. The soulful company is the organization that knows how 
to not just _tap_ that part of us, but _feed_ it as well.
