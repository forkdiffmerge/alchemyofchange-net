#  Welcome, fellow Tweeter! 

My name is Gideon Rosenblatt. Thanks for interrupting your tweeting to stop 
by. My writings here on Alchemy of Change cover a range of topics, but pivot 
on a central theme, which is **keeping humanity burning bright in the organizations, 
technologies and other stuff we build**.

I write mostly about the impact that technology has on people, organizations 
and society. Here’s a quick overview of [what I cover on Alchemy of Change][1]. 

I’m a technologist with a background in business _and_ social change. I worked 
at Microsoft for nearly ten years in marketing and building building some pretty 
cool stuff. I then ran a mission-driven technology consulting group, called 
Groundwire. Now I write. Want more detail? Here’s [my full story][2].

As a fellow Twitter user, here are two articles you might like:

* 
[Twitter is Not a Social Network][3] has some great stats on how people actually use Twitter and some conclusions about what the network really is – and is not.
* 
[Twitter’s Golden Egg][4] is about people like you – “Information Networkers” who are the true engine of Twitter’s “real-time information network.”

Thanks again for stopping by and happy Tweeting!
