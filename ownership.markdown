#  Ownership and Accountability 

[![][1]][2]A preoccupation with short-term movements in stock prices results 
in an antiquated view of value creation.

When we separate ownership and equity from accountability, we end up with dysfunctional organizational 
behavior. When the shareholder perspective is the _only_ reason for a corporation’s 
existence, profit becomes a destructive rather than a creative force, taking 
management’s focus away from the long-term sustainability of the organization, 
its people and the communities in which it exists, and it can result in great 
harm to the planet.

When equity and ownership are aligned with contribution and accountability, 
the profit incentive can help reinforce the value creation process of the firm. 
Those most involved in value creation are rewarded with the upside of their 
initiative, helping to build a positive feedback loop that creates a true and 
deep sense of ownership in any enterprise.

Marjorie Kelly’s [The Divine Right of Capital][5] is one of those mind-bending 
books that deserves to be read by a large audience. It tells a behind-the-scenes 
story of capitalism that we don’t often hear; one that shows how our preoccupation 
with shareholder “primacy” distorts capitalism in ways that generate serious 
harm for society and the planet. Kelly shows how our current problems with 
capitalism are not necessarily intrinsic to market forces or even capitalism 
itself, but to the particular version of it that we have today.
