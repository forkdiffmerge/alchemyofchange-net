#  The Company as a Living System 

[![Beautiful Organization][1]][2]

For the next generation of companies, we need to move beyond seeing _organizations 
as machines_ and begin seeing them** as open, living systems that are inherently 
social and alive**.

We can learn a lot about organizations from biology. The way cells connect 
with one another and with their environment offers a particularly rich metaphor 
for rethinking the organization.

The boundary between what’s inside and what’s outside the firm is where the 
future of organizational thinking now lies. The membrane is a powerful metaphor 
for the way modern organizations connect with people, organizations, and their 
environment more generally.

The membrane that surrounds the organization and connects it with its external 
environment is made out of a wonderful layer of humanity. What’s more the number 
of people involved in helping organizations exchange information with the outside 
world is radically multiplying and decentralizing.

Companies need to move beyond the old, mechanistic strategies for connecting 
and collaborating. To thrive today, they must now look to the biology-inspired 
strategies of networks. This is the evolution of the firm – a move away from 
the self-reliance of yesterday, to the radical connectedness of today.

###

Trust makes networks work. When trust is high among members of a network, there’s 
a wonderful cohesiveness and capacity to get work done. When it’s low and relationships 
are plagued by suspicion, networks collapse into brittle organizational structures 
that rarely offset their operational costs in real world outcomes.

### [Twitter is Not a Social Network][12]

Twitter is not a social network. It’s a “real-time information network” and 
once you see it that way, its competitive edges look a lot closer to Google 
than Facebook. Facebook is a social network utility, while Twitter is a social 
network application with real-time information as its end goal.
